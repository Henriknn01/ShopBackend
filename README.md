# ShopBackend
ShopBackend is a backend system for an ecommerce shopping website with database models focused on clothing, but it is designed to be very general and easily adaptable to other types of products.

## Getting Started
To use ShopBackend, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need to install the required Python packages, which are listed in the requirements.txt file. 
You can install these packages using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next, you will need to set up a database for ShopBackend to use. By default, ShopBackend is configured to use a SQLite database, but you can use any database supported by Django.
To set up the database, run the following command:

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate`

Finally, you can start the development server by running:

`python manage.py runserver`

Database Models
ShopBackend comes with several database models pre-defined, including models for products, categories, and orders. 

## API Endpoints
ShopBackend provides a RESTful API for interacting with the database. The following endpoints are available:
